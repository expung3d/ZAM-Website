                                    <h2>Malden's History</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Originally colonized by French explorers during the 1800s, colonizers established many of the current settlements and villages on the island today. Post Napoleonic Wars, in which France was defeated by the Prussian Empire, Malden was seized and conquered by Imperial Russia for its naval fleet. Despite Russian influence over the island, pre-war French culture and traditions remained and stayed to this day. <br/><br/>
                                        With the collapse of Imperial Russia in 1917, Malden gained its independence and became a microstate free of influence. It would remain free of influence until the arrival of NATO forces in the 1960s. <br/><br/>
                                        During the Cold War, NATO secured a treaty with Malden’s population. In this symbiotic relationship NATO would be allowed to use Malden’s island for its own strategic military advances and NATO would provide Malden a guarantee of security. Mostly used as a supply station for aircraft and other forces moving from the United States and West Germany, Malden was not used significantly. <br/><br/>
                                        In 1985, rogue Soviet forces illegally invaded and occupied southern Malden, forcing the small number of NATO troops stationed there to be pushed against a wall. That is, until NATO reinforcements arrived and all of Malden was ridded of Soviet aggression. <br/><br/>
                                        In Fall of 1986, Malden officially formed its own government with a Prime Minister at the head. The first PM was Étienne Sault (1986-1994). <br/><br/>
                                        During the late 2010s, ties between NATO and Malden deteriorated. As economic depression hit most western nations during the early 2020s, a U.S. withdrawal from its bases on Malden collapsed their relations. The hasty withdrawal was worsened by U.S. carelessness in handling Cold War-era munition stockpiles. From these mishandlings many U.S. bases were left rusted and contaminated. Some of these bases are still there currently. Few accidents occurred in Malden because of this recklessness, however, several Maldenian contractors were killed because of this. The U.S. refused to compensate the families of those killed. <br/><br/>
                                        Due to the poor exit by U.S. forces, the Malden population looked to increase relations with eastern forces, eventually eyeing CSAT. Malden then allowed CSAT to use its island in return for security for Malden and relations between CSAT and Malden increased rapidly. Malden had especially close ties with CSAT’s North African allies. However, during the mid-2030s most of Malden’s population began to have negative opinions of CSAT and aimed to distance themselves from their influence. <br/><br/>
                                        In 2035, U.S. relations were restored after U.S. troops invaded the island to remove the North African CSAT garrison from the island. No Chinese CSAT were involved. <br/><br/>

                                        Malden is not a member of the United Nations, however, they do have a minimal government with a Prime Minister elected every 4 years. Malden does not have an armed population, firearms have been outlawed since 1994 in the Malden Defense of Citizens Act of 1994. A bill proposed after a shooting occurred in La Pessagne in 1993, where 9 were killed and 17 injured. <br/><br/>
                                        <b>Current Prime Minister</b> (2034-Present):<br/>
                                        Benoit Dupont, 61 <br/><br/>

                                    <p>
                                        Due to the relatively small size of Malden’s island, less than 500 troops are in the Malden Defense Force, the island’s primary military force. Approximately another 100 volunteers who are not on active duty are also enlisted in the MDF. <br/><br/>
                                        Malden has a small police force, the Gendamere, with under 100 officers for the whole island. Given the small population and lack of civil-rights issues within the country the relations between the civilians and the Gendamere are incredibly good. <br/><br/>

                                        Given Malden’s scenic terrain and fair climate most of Malden’s economy comes from Tourism. Most of Malden’s exports consist of wine products and dairy goods from their extensive vineyards and goat population respectively. Malden is particularly famous for its goat cheese from la Pessagne. <br/><br/>
